# Automatic-Stage-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. This occurs when diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels inside the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This tiny blood vessel will leak blood and fluid on the retina, forming features such as micro-aneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates, cotton wool spots, or venous loops. Globally, the number of people with DR will grow from 126.6 million in 2010 to 191.0 million by 2030, and the estimated number with vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) will increase from 37.3 million to 56.3 million, if prompt action is not taken.

DR has four stages; Mild non-proliferative retinopathy, Moderate non-proliferative retinopathy, Severe non-proliferative retinopathy and Proliferative retinopathy. Each of these stages can be clinically diagnosed by the detection of funduscopic signs of retinal microvascular complications. However, a notable challenge arises due to the potential variability in diagnoses among healthcare professionals where the diagnosis can be subjective, and instances where subtle manifestations may not be readily notable through visual inspection alone. This leads to mal-treated or undiagnosed DR, progressing the situations to critical retinopathy stages. Precise and timely measurement of the DR stage is crucial to preventing vision loss in patients with Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR). Furthermore, the rising global prevalence of diabetes places an increasing burden on healthcare systems, making it challenging to provide timely screenings for all individuals at risk of NPDR.
This research aims to design and implement a robust and accurate automatic stage detection system for NPDR.
